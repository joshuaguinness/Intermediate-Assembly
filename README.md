# Intermediate-Assembly

To run the program, type: make, then type: ./lab5_1 with another command line argument either 1 or 2.

To clean, type: make clean



The program expects two command line arguments, the name of the program and one argument which is either 1 or 2. If these conditions are not met, the program terminates with an error message. 

If the second command line argument is "1," it then calls a subroutine, passing in the argument as a parameter, and prints out the array 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

If the command line argument is "2," it calls the same subroutine, passing in the "2" as a parameter, then printing out the array 11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20
